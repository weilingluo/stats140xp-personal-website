# ASA DataFest 2025 — Commercial Real Estate Analytics

Analyzed **200K+ commercial lease records (2018–2024)** from Savills to uncover post-COVID leasing trends in Manhattan’s financial sector.

## Key Insights
- Manhattan dominated U.S. office leasing volume both before and after COVID.  
- Class-A demand increased **50%**, while B/C space lagged.  
- South Manhattan ZIP codes (10001, 10022) showed the highest square footage.  
- Availability remained high (15–20%), giving tenants leverage.  
- Hybrid work reduced seating needs but intensified “flight-to-quality.”

## My Contributions
- Cleaned and analyzed 200K+ leasing records  
- Visualized geographic clustering, Class-A trends, and occupancy correlations  
- Co-developed the narrative, insights, and final presentation
