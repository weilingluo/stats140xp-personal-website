# Music Genre & Cognitive Focus (STAT 101B)

A two-factor ANOVA with blocking (age & gender) analyzed how **music genre** and **listening duration** affect sustained attention.

## Key Findings
- **Significant main effects**: music type (p < 0.001), duration (p = 0.013)  
- **Significant interaction**: genre × duration (p = 0.010)  
- Heavy metal increased attention misses, especially at 30 minutes.  
- Classical, Country, and Dance music maintained cognitive performance.  

## Methods
- 216 participants (multistage sampling)  
- Blocking by age group and gender  
- Tukey HSD to compare genre and duration levels  
- ggplot2 visualizations (interaction plots + boxplots)

## My Contributions
- Built ANOVA model & diagnostics  
- Created interaction and boxplot visualizations  
- Wrote narrative analysis and interpretation sections
