# Lasso Regression & Federated Learning (STAT 102B)

This project implemented **coordinate descent Lasso** and extended it into a **federated learning system** where three nodes trained shared models without exchanging raw data.

## Part A — Local Lasso
- Implemented cyclic coordinate descent with soft-thresholding  
- Tuned λ via validation loss (grid search)  
- Found **13 overlapping predictors** across nodes  
- Smaller datasets required stronger regularization  
- Sparser models generalized better  

## Part B — Federated Lasso
- Nodes independently tuned λ  
- Performed U local updates, then aggregated weighted coefficients  
- Compared **5-update vs. 10-update** synchronization  
- Federated model matched test accuracy of best node while reducing variance  
- Less frequent aggregation reduced communication at no accuracy cost  

## My Contributions
- Wrote full coordinate descent implementation  
- Built federated synchronization loop and coefficient aggregator  
- Visualized convergence + coefficient shrinkage patterns  
- Wrote project analysis, discussion, and methodology sections
