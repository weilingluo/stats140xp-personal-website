# Australia Bushfires Digital Humanities Project  
**Digital Humanities 101 Final — Summer 2025**

A full web-based mini-site analyzing the **2019–2020 Australian bushfires** using NASA FIRMS & MODIS fire datasets.

**Live Website:** https://firestorm.humspace.ucla.edu/

## Core Features
- Interactive **geospatial fire map**  
- **Timeline** of major fire events  
- MODIS/NASA-based charts on fire spread & intensity  
- Narrative analysis of environmental + social impacts  
- Data critique discussing limitations & representational gaps  

## Insights
- Fire activity peaked during late 2019–early 2020  
- Southeastern Australia showed extreme density and severity  
- Climate anomalies (drought, heat) amplified risk  
- Human communities experienced disparate impacts based on geography  

## My Contributions
- Processed fire-archive datasets (NASA/MODIS)  
- Built interactive map, timeline, and statistical visualizations  
- Wrote narrative sections, visualization explanations, and data critique  
- Connected data findings to climate change + social vulnerability

## Files
- Public mini-site hosted on HumSpace
