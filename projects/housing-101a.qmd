# Housing Price Prediction (STAT 101A) — Winter 2025

This project applied multiple linear regression to model housing unit-area prices in Sindian District, New Taipei City, Taiwan. After using transformations, model selection, and diagnostics, our final model improved R² from ~0.58 to **0.72**.

## Overview
- Analyzed 414 real estate observations with six predictors  
- Explored scatterplots, transformations, multicollinearity, and model assumptions  
- Applied log transformation to Y and MRT distance to stabilize variance and improve fit  
- Selected the final model using Adjusted R², AIC, and diagnostics  

## Key Findings
- Houses newer, close to MRT, and near convenience stores had significantly higher prices.  
- Latitude & longitude revealed geographic price patterns across northern and eastern districts.  
- The final model explained **72.4%** of price variation.

## My Contributions
- Data preprocessing, transformations, diagnostics  
- Model selection and interpretation  
- Presentation slides and narrative explanation
